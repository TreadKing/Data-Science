    "## Dataset and Background\n",
    "Food spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types, a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality assurance. You are given a time series dataset obtained after spectral analysis of fresh fruit purees [(Holland et al. 1999)](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199802)76:2%3C263::AID-JSFA943%3E3.0.CO;2-F). The classes are strawberry (authentic samples) and non-strawberry (adulterated strawberries and other fruits) [encoded as `S1` and `S2`]. The dataset contains 983 time series instances. Each timseries has a length of 235. Note here that time series are stored in the rows. The data can be read from `Strawberry_TS.csv` (therefore, place it in the same directory as this starter code). In this practical exam, you will explore this data and build predictive models. Note here that while the specifics and details of data is given for completeness, they are not relevant for the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of time series are represented in the cells corresponding to columns $\\{t0, t1, ... t234\\}$.\n",
    "The `index` is the identifier of the instances. The `Class` column shows the class of time series and is your target variable. \n"
